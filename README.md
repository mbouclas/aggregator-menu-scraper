## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### Single Site Scraping
```bash

python scraper.py "https://www.foody.com.cy/delivery/menu/costa-coffee"
python scraper.py "https://wolt.com/en/cyp/nicosia/restaurant/nomad-bread-coffee-nicosia"

# Legacy mode (fallback)
python scraper.py "https://www.foody.com.cy/delivery/menu/costa-coffee" --mode legacy
```

### Batch Processing
```bash
# Process all sites in config
python batch_scraper.py

# Process specific number of sites
python batch_scraper.py --sites 5

# Custom configuration
python batch_scraper.py --config config/custom.json

# Dry run to see what would be processed
python batch_scraper.py --dry-run

# Skip database import
python batch_scraper.py --no-import
```

### Fast Batch Processing
```bash
# Ultra-fast parallel processing
python fast_batch_scraper.py

# Process with verbose logging
python fast_batch_scraper.py --sites 3 --verbose
```

### Optimization Features
- **🚫 Disabled Resources**: Images, CSS, fonts blocked for faster loading
- **⏱️ Reduced Timeouts**: 10s vs 30s for faster failure detection
- **🎯 Smart Selectors**: Optimized DOM traversal patterns
- **🔄 Resource Blocking**: Aggressive content filtering
- **💾 Memory Efficient**: Minimal browser footprint

## 📁 **Configuration**

### Batch Configuration (config/scraper.json)
```json
{
    "workerCount": 4,
    "sites": [
        "https://www.foody.com.cy/delivery/menu/costa-coffee",
        "https://wolt.com/en/cyp/nicosia/restaurant/kfc-engomi"
    ]
}
```

### Domain Configuration (scrapers/wolt.json)
```json
{
    "domain": "wolt.com",
    "scraping_method": "selenium",
    "requires_javascript": true,
    "selectors": {
        "restaurant_name": "h1",
        "products": "h3[data-test-id='horizontal-item-card-header']",
        "categories": "h2.h129y4wz"
    }
}
```

## 🗄️ **Database Schema**

### Core Tables
- `restaurants`: Restaurant information and metadata
- `categories`: Product categories with hierarchical structure
- `products`: Product details with pricing and availability
- `product_price_history`: Time-series price tracking
- `scraping_sessions`: Session metadata and performance metrics

### Business Intelligence Views
```sql
-- Current product prices by platform
SELECT * FROM current_product_prices WHERE scraper_name = 'wolt';

-- Price comparison between platforms
SELECT scraper_name, AVG(price), COUNT(*) 
FROM current_product_prices 
GROUP BY scraper_name;

-- Performance metrics
SELECT scraper_name, AVG(processing_duration_seconds)
FROM scraping_sessions 
WHERE scraped_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
GROUP BY scraper_name;
```

## � **Monitoring & Analytics**

### Performance Metrics
```bash
# Check recent scraping performance
python database/analytics.py --performance

# Compare platform pricing
python database/analytics.py --pricing-comparison

# View scraping session history
python database/analytics.py --sessions --days 7
```

### Output Analysis
Each scraping session generates detailed metadata:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "performance_mode": "fast_playwright",
    "processing_duration_seconds": 13.67,
    "product_count": 138,
    "category_count": 169,
    "optimization_features": [
      "disabled_images",
      "disabled_css",
      "reduced_timeouts",
      "fast_selectors"
    ],
    "timing_breakdown": {
      "driver_startup": 0.85,
      "page_load": 2.79,
      "content_extraction": 10.02
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 **Advanced Usage**

### Custom Scraper Development
```python
from src.common.fast_playwright_utils import FastPlaywrightManager
from src.scrapers.base_scraper import BaseScraper

class CustomFastScraper(BaseScraper):
    def __init__(self, url: str):
        super().__init__(url)
        self.playwright_manager = FastPlaywrightManager()
    
    def scrape(self):
        # Use fast Playwright implementation
        pass
```

### Performance Tuning
```python
# Customize optimization settings
manager = FastPlaywrightManager(
    timeout=5000,          # 5 second timeout
    disable_images=True,   # Block images
    disable_css=True,      # Block CSS
    headless=True         # Run headless
)
```
